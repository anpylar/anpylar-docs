Tutorial - Tour of Pyroes
#########################

*AnPyLar* is modelled after the ideas and concepts found in Google's
*Angular*. As such it does pay tribute by building on the *Heroes* tutorial,
but with a *Py* approach.

At the same time and to depart from it, the tutorial will also pay tribute to
the TV Series *Heroes* (2006-2010) in what you will come to know as the
*Pyroes*.

You can see (and play the samples live), just follow the links:

  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 1 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top1>`_
  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 2 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top2>`_
  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 3 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top3>`_
  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 4 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top4>`_
  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 5 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top5>`_
  - `Tour of Pyroes - Part 6 <https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/top6>`_

The platform aims at versatility, flexibility and last but no least, saving the
world as the *Pyroes* would do. Ok, it will only try to save the day of the
developer. And that means: not forcing the user's hand into working like this
or like that. Rather the opposite by offering different ways to do the thing
and even mix and match the different ways.

That's the reason why *Part 0* of the tutorial is presented with three
different approaches, whose names are based on the role the developer wishes to
work with:

  - *Htmlista*

      The user won't in most cases render anything in the component, because
      the work will be in the *html* content in the form of special
      attributes. Some rendering work may still be needed for special cases.

  - *Selectista*

      The component has associated regular html content. The render code uses
      the ``select`` DOM method of the html nodes to find the html elements and
      manipulate them.

  - *Pythonista*

      No html content is provided for the component, because the component
      produces the content programmatically, obviously ... in Python.

At the end of the day, most people will work in mixed mode to support real life
development use cases. As such, the other parts of the tutorial will also, when
needed, mix the working modes.

Enjoy!
