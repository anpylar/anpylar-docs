Basics
######

The most basic possible architecture to have an *AnPyLar* app needs:

  - A *Module* (a subclass of ``anpylar.Module``)
  - A *Component* (a subclass or ``anpylar.Component``)

More complex setups are possible and will be the usual scenario including:

  - Services

  - Submodules

  - Subcomponents

  - Routing
